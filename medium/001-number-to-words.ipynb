    "We are using fstrings to print data in our desired format. Inside fstring we are just calling the function converter that converts the number into words. The number we pass onto the function, however, should have the length that is multiplt of three so we use `zfill` method to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of `zfill` method.\n",

    "You get the idea. It fills the string with 0 for the reamining length.\n",

    "So we are just checking if the length of the input number (num) is multiple of 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "If yes, `n` is assigned the length of the number. If no, we integer divide the length by 3 and add 1 to mutiply again by 3 to get a number that is multiple of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we use this value of n and put it in `zfill` function to get the number that has length which is multiple of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we make sure, length of number is multiple of 3, we pass the number to converter function which converts it into words and return it back. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we slice the last two character of word which will be `', '` to only get words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we again use `rstrip()` function to remove any whitespace present in the right hand side. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then use the `capitalize()` function to capitalize the first alphabet of the string. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we add a period at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing all these operations under fstring, we print it to view it to the user using print function, of course.\n",
